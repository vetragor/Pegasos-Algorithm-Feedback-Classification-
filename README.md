This is Machine Learning Project. This code will convert review texts into feature vectors using a bag of words approach. We start by compiling all the words that appear in a training set of reviews into a dictionary , thereby producing a list of  d  unique words.  Then transform each of the reviews into a feature vector of length  d  by setting the  ith  coordinate of the feature vector to  1  if the  ith word in the dictionary appears in the review, or  0  otherwise. For instance, consider two simple documents “Mary loves apples" and “Red apples". In this case, the dictionary is the set  {Mary;loves;apples;red} , and the documents are represented as  (1;1;1;0)  and  (0;0;1;1) .
